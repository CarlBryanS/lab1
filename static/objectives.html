<p><strong>Turrets</strong> - also called towers, are heavy fortifications that block the advance of enemy minions and champions. Turrets are one core component of League of Legends. 
    They deal damage to enemies and provide vision and general control of the battlefield to their team. 
    Champions must destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into enemy territory. Turrets target one unit at a time and deal heavy damage.</p>
<img src="images/Inhibitor.png">
<p><strong>Inhibitor</strong> - are structures that block the training of enemy super minions in their respective same lane. Inhibitors have 4000 health, 15 health regeneration per second, 20 armor, and no magic resistance.
        Once an enemy team's inhibitor is destroyed, the Nexus will start spawning Super Minions (replacing the siege minions with Super Minions if the wave normally includes one).</p>
<img src="images/Nexus.png">
<p><strong>The Nexus</strong> - is the primary objective in every League of Legends gamemode. A team only wins the match when their opposition's Nexus is destroyed.</p>
<img src="images/Dragon.png">
<p><strong>Dragons</strong> - also known as drakes, are powerful monsters that can be found in Summoner's Rift. Once killed, gives the team who killed it a buff based on the type of dragon it was. In the game, there are 5 types of dragons that can spawn:
    Cloud, Infernal, Mountain, and Ocean. An Elder Dragon spawns at 35 minutes in game.</p>   

<img src="images/RiftHerald.png">
<p><strong>The Rift Herald</strong> - is a powerful neutral monster on Summoner's Rift, that occupies the same pit as Baron Nashor. She uses basic attacks and abilities to fight her foes. 
    Slaying the Rift Herald drops the Eye of the Herald in the pit for 40 seconds that can be picked up by one member of the slayer's team, 
    granting them Empowered Recall and the ability to summon the Rift Herald to push a lane.
    The Rift Herald only spawns once per game. It despawns permanently at 19:45, or 19:55 if in combat. Baron Nashor then spawns in the same position at 20:00. </p>
<img src="images/Baron.png">
<p><strong>Baron Nashor</strong> - is the most powerful neutral monster on Summoner's Rift in League of Legends. 
    Killing Baron Nashor grants Hand of Baron to all living teammates for 210 seconds. The buff gives bonus attack damage, bonus ability power, 
    Empowered Recall, and an aura that greatly increases the power of nearby minions. </p>
