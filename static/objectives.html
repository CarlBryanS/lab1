<img src="images/RiftHerald.png">
<p>The Rift Herald is a powerful neutral monster on Summoner's Rift, that occupies the same pit as Baron Nashor. She uses basic attacks and abilities to fight her foes. 
    Slaying the Rift Herald drops the Eye of the Herald in the pit for 40 seconds that can be picked up by one member of the slayer's team, 
    granting them Empowered Recall and the ability to summon the Rift Herald to push a lane.
    The Rift Herald only spawns once per game. It despawns permanently at 19:45, or 19:55 if in combat. Baron Nashor then spawns in the same position at 20:00. </p>

<p>Baron Nashor is the most powerful neutral monster on Summoner's Rift in League of Legends. 
    Killing Baron Nashor grants Hand of Baron to all living teammates for 210 seconds. The buff gives bonus attack damage, bonus ability power, 
    Empowered Recall, and an aura that greatly increases the power of nearby minions. </p>
