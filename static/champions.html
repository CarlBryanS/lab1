      <img src="images/Marksman.png">
	  <strong>Marksman</strong> - is a champion type that specializes at dealing physical damage at enemies from a long range. 
	  Marksmen are capable of taking down even the toughest of opponents when positioned behind the safety of their team.

	  <strong>Fighter</strong> - (also known as Bruisers) are a diverse group of short-ranged combatants who excel at both dealing and surviving damage. 
	  With easy access to heavy, continuous damage (or DPS) and a host of innate defenses, 
	  fighters thrive in extended fights as they seek out enemies to take down.

	  <strong>Mage</strong> - Mages are champions who typically 
	  possess great reach, ability-based area of effect damage and crowd control, 
	  and who use all of these strengths in tandem with each other to trap and destroy enemies from a distance. 
	  <img src="images/Assassin.png">
	  <strong>Assassin</strong> - are highly mobile champions specializing in single-target burst damage. 
	  What they generally lack in resilience, they more than make up for in their potential to cover large distances, quickly kill priority targets and retreat just as fast.

	  <img src="images/Tank.png">
	  <strong>Tank</strong> - are tough melee champions who sacrifice damage in exchange for powerful crowd control. 
	  While able to engage enemies in combat, a tank's purpose isn't usually to kill opponents; rather, tanks excel at disrupting enemies and diverting focus to themselves.
	  <img src="images/Specialist.png">
	  <strong>Specialist</strong> - are a diverse group of champions who do not "fit into a neat little box" in regards to other 
	  class/subclass specifications.

	  <img src="images/Support.png">
	  <strong>Controller</strong> - assist their allies with potent utility and keep enemies at bay with crowd control. 
	  Weak when alone, supports are capable of massively amplifying their teammates' 
	  power to become the strongest class in group combat (or teamfights).
