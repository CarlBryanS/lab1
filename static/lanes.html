<p><strong>Lanes</strong> - are the main paths that minions follow toward the Nexus. Due to this, they are defended by turrets planted along the path that must be destroyed in order to push into the enemy base. 
	Each successive turret in a lane must be destroyed before damage can be dealt to the next structure. Along each lane are located areas of brush for tactical maneuvering, such as juking and ganking. 
	Controlling a lane is a key tactical component of gameplay; early lane control in a game can put your opponents at a disadvantage by keeping them away from your turrets and denying last hits on minions 
	for much-needed gold. Summoner's Rift has 3 lanes (Top, Bottom and Middle) which are defended by 3 turrets (Outer, Inner, Inhibitor). 
	Each adjacent lane is connected from different passages through the Jungle or by the river that runs diagonally through the map.</p>
