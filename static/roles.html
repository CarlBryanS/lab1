<p><strong>Top Laner</strong> -Within a drafted team, the Top Laner is the champion assigned to the top lane. A Top Laner needs to have high survability, high damage or engages. 
	Top laners are champions (or the players of those champions) that tend to spend the lane phase farming in the Top Lane, though sometimes teams will swap their lanes, so the top laner will be in the Bottom Lane. 
	Top laners tend to be self-sufficient champions during the lane phase, not needing significant help from another champion to stay alive. There are two main styles of top lane champions: tanks and carries. Tank top lane champions generally try to soak damage from the enemy backline while their own backline kills the enemy frontline. 
	Carry top lane champions generally try either to splitpush or to carry fights for their team as if they were a mid lane mage. </p>

<p><strong>Jungler</strong> -Within a drafted team, the Jungler is the champion assigned to the jungle. A Jungler needs to be able to clear jungle camps without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane. </p>

<p><strong>Mid Laner</strong> -Within a drafted team, the Mid Laner is the champion assigned to the mid lane. A Mid Laner needs to have high burst damage. </p>

<p<strong>Bottom Carry</strong> ->Within a drafted team, the Bottom Carry is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the Support. Being the most vulnerable, 
	the Bottom Carry has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential. 
	Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to farm while the other is recommended to purchase an economy item. 
	The Bottom Carry is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that are highly dependant on item-based power spikes. </p>

<p><strong>Support</strong> -Within a drafted team, the Support is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the Bottom Carry. 
	This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
	Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to farm while the other is recommended to purchase an economy item. 
	The Support is expected to fulfil the latter designation, and consequently the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependant on item-based power spikes. 
	The Support is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's vision. </p>
